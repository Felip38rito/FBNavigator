# FBNavigator
A SOLID (at least wannabe) and simple implementation of navigation

The objective of this simple lib is to help me with navigation when coding iOS native apps. 
With this project, I have 3 principles to follow:

- You can navigate from ANY controller to ANY controller, without requiring that they know each other (they shouldn't... SOLID, remember?)
- You can implement your own schema of navigation just by implementing the protocols. You don't have to be bounded by UIKit navigation... you can implement your own on the same pattern
- Allow you to write your navigation with controllers the way you like it. Be it with controllers instantiated from storyboards, xibs, or by pure swift code. That's for you to choose, not me. ;)
